The HEP community was amongst the first to develop suitable software and computing tools for this task. In recent times, new open source toolkits and systems collectively called \"Big Data\" technologies have emerged to support the analysis of Petabyte and Exabyte datasets. While the principles of data analysis in HEP have not changed (filtering and transforming experiment-specific data formats), these new technologies use different approaches and promise a fresh look at analysis of very large datasets and could potentially reduce the time-to-physics with increased interactivity. The CMS Big Data Project explores these new open source data analytics toolkits and has the following goals Reduce time-to-physics Educate our graduate students and post docs to use industry-based technologies Improves chances on the job market outside academia Increases the attractiveness of our field Use tools developed in larger communities reaching outside of our field The starting point is Apache Spark and we are working on the following thrusts Full Analysis in Apache Spark CERN openlab/Intel CMS Big Data Reduction Facility Big Data analytics at HPC centers All thrusts are based on reproducing a CMS physics analysis with open source data analytics frameworks in various settings, based on Apache Spark.","tags":"pages","title":""},{"url":"pages/pubsntalks.html.html","text":"Publications Talks","tags":"pages","title":"Publications and Talks"},{"url":"pages/theteam.html.html","text":"The Team working on the CMS Big Data Project Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory Matteo Cremonesi Oliver Gutsche Bo Jayatilaka Jim Kowalkowski Saba Sehrish Princeton University Peter Elmer Jim Pivarski Alexey Svyatkovskiy CERN IT Department Maria Girone Luca Canali Kacper Surdy Vaggelis Motesnitsalis Simons Foundation Ian Fisk University of Iowa Viktor Khristenko","tags":"pages","title":"The Team"}]}
